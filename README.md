# Discord Server Nuker

Are you pissed at a server that your staff in?

Do you fucking hate the server owner?

Do you want to watch ~~the world~~ a Discord server burn?

Well I got the perfect program for you! Server Nuker!

Server Nuker is a powerful Node.js program that will destroy any Discord server that you have Admin/Mod/Staff in.

# Disclaimer ⚠


This program is **very powerful.** It runs **very fast** on small servers but (less than 250 members). And it only takes a minute to **ban everyone in the server, and delete all roles/channels.**. **I am not responsible** for any damage you do with this tool, or any punishments you get from the server owners, **or even Discord Staff (They could ban your account for API abuse)**. Please use this tool on an alt account or on a bot account. Don't fucking blame me if your server got nuked with this.
